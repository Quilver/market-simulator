# market-simulator
This was a procedural simulation I developed after being inspired by Dwarf Fortress. It procedurally generates a world, populates the world with settlements and creates markets for those settlements based on the availability of resources. It was developed in C++. As of this moment, it generates a world as described. I finished at this point because continuing would involve developing an AI for around 1200 agents.
